# Stardew Vally Crop Data Visualization Project
## Purpose
This project explores player data from Stardew Valley, a farming simulation game known for its open-ended gameplay and rich in-game economy. The purpose of this project is to practice data analysis and visualization techniques while uncovering interesting patterns and insights from the game world. The final product of the visualizations were produced on Tableau. 

For this assignment, I attempted to visualize the similarities and differences between
Stardew Valley crops by season. I wanted to know if crops of certain seasons had longer
growing times, more outliers, or more crops with multiple harvests. I was also interested in
looking at crops across seasons with similar growing times. Ultimately visualizing this kind of
data could impact which crops a player may choose to plant in the game. With additional price
data, players can easily identify whether or not a crop with a long growing time is worth it
depending on the projected profit. Since my original dataset did not include price, I annotated
my graphs with specific price information for outliers, the crops with the shortest and longest
growing times per season and comparing crops from different seasons with the same growing
time.


## Data
I focused on the period from 05/04/2019 to 01/04/2024, mapping out common walking routes to and from the hospital from three distinct apartments where I lived while working as a nurse. I sourced the data from the Charlottesville Police Department website. Although the original police data did not include longitude and latitude columns, I used the GoogleMaps API to convert the address included in the dataset to the corresponding longitudes and latitudes.
